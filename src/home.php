            <h2>Why Is Photography Important for Conservation?</h2>
            <p>
                There are a few ways in which photography is valuable to conservation. 
            Firstly, dedicated conservation photographers have the ability to raise 
            awareness of the plight faced by endangered species and habitats through 
            evocative images that create an emotional connection for viewers.
            Secondly, wildlife photography is a major driver of the demand for 
            conservation tourism, and as such contributes significantly to the protection
            of wilderness landscapes. Finally, through citizen science initiatives,
            photographers are able to contribute to conservation management by sharing
            their images with research programmes and online atlasing databases.

            <h2>Photos represent what’s important</h2>
            <p>
            
            In our phone galleries and homes, we have images that are important to us.

            The reason why photography is important is that it freezes memories. 
            It captures a moment in time that you’ll be able to remember and cherish years from now.
            If you look at the images that people save, usually it’s photos of their family, friends,
            pets, places, and items they love. You take pictures of things that are significant to you.
            All of the images you capture add up to tell your story.
